[Approved by Governor June 30, 2022. Filed with Secretary of
State June 30, 2022.]
legislative counsel’s digest
AB 195, Committee on Budget. Cannabis.
(1) The Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA),
an initiative measure approved as Proposition 64 at the November 8, 2016,
statewide general election, authorizes a person who obtains a state license
under AUMA to engage in commercial adult-use cannabis activity pursuant
to that license and applicable local ordinances. Existing law, the Medicinal
and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), among
other things, consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial
medicinal and adult-use cannabis activities. MAUCRSA establishes the
Department of Cannabis Control within the Business, Consumer Services,
and Housing Agency to administer the act, and requires the department to
be under the supervision and control of a director.
Existing law specifies the annual compensation for various directors of
state departments and agencies, including the Director of Transportation
and the Director of Fish and Wildlife.
This bill would require the annual compensation for the Director of
Cannabis Control to be consistent with the directors described above.
(2) Chapter 70 of the Statutes of 2021 established the Department of
Cannabis Control and transferred to this department, except as specified,
the powers, duties, purposes, functions, responsibilities, and jurisdiction
under MAUCRSA of the former Bureau of Cannabis Control in the
Department of Consumer Affairs, the Department of Food and Agriculture,
and the State Department of Public Health which are collectively referred
to as licensing authorities.
95
MAUCRSA authorizes the Department of Cannabis Control to issue state
licenses only to qualified applicants. MAUCRSA requires, among other
things, that each licensee electronically submit to the Department of Justice
fingerprint images and related information for the purpose of obtaining
information as to the existence and content of a record of state or federal
convictions and state and federal arrests. Existing law, until July 1, 2022,
authorizes employees of a licensing authority, acting on behalf of the
Department of Cannabis Control, to receive criminal history information
for these purposes.
This bill would allow employees of a licensing authority, acting on behalf
of the Department of Cannabis Control, to receive criminal history
information for the purposes described above until July 1, 2023.
MAUCRSA requires an applicant for a state license, with 20 or more
employees, to provide a notarized statement that the applicant will enter
into, or demonstrate that it has already entered into, and abide by the terms
of a labor peace agreement.
This bill, beginning July 1, 2024, would instead require an applicant for
a state license with 10 or more employees to provide a notarized statement
that the applicant will enter into, or demonstrate that it has already entered
into, and abide by the terms of a labor peace agreement.
This bill would specify that compliance with the terms of an applicable
labor peace agreement is a condition of licensure, and would authorize the
Department of Cannabis Control to suspend, revoke, place on probation
with terms and conditions, or otherwise discipline the license and fine the
licensee, if the department determines the licensee has not complied with
these provisions, as provided. The bill would authorize any labor
organization, as defined, or any current or former employee of the relevant
licensee, to file a complaint with the Agricultural Labor Relations Board
that an organization with which a licensee has entered into a labor peace
agreement is not a bona fide labor organization, and would establish
procedures for the board’s review of that complaint.
(3) MAUCRSA authorizes local jurisdictions to enforce its provisions
and to regulate cannabis businesses, as specified.
This bill, until January 1, 2025, would establish a task force on state and
local regulation of commercial cannabis activity to promote communication
between state and local entities engaged in the regulation of commercial
cannabis activity and facilitate cooperation to enforce applicable state and
local laws, consisting of specified members from state agencies and all local
jurisdictions regulating commercial cannabis activity that opt to participate.
The bill would exempt meetings of the task force from the Bagley-Keene
Open Meeting Act and the Brown Act.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the
right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public
officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest
protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

Ch. 56
(4) MAUCRSA imposes civil penalties on a person who aids and abets
unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, as specified.
Existing law makes it a crime for a person who has management or control
of a building, room, space, or enclosure, either as an owner, lessee, agent,
employee, or mortgagee, to knowingly rent, lease, or make available for
use, with or without compensation, the building, room, space, or enclosure,
for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing, or distributing a
controlled substance for sale or distribution
This bill would amend AUMA by imposing a civil penalty of up to
$10,000 per violation against a person who has management or control of
a commercial property or a commercial building, room, space, or enclosure
and knowingly rents, leases, or makes it available for the unlicensed
cultivation, manufacture, storage, sale, or distribution of cannabis. The bill
would make each day the violation continues a separate violation for this
purpose. The bill would require an action for these civil penalties to be
brought exclusively by the Attorney General on behalf of the people, on
behalf of the department, or on behalf of the participating agency, or by a
city or county counsel or city prosecutor.
Existing law requires that deliveries, as defined, of cannabis or cannabis
products only be made by a licensed retailer or microbusiness or a licensed
nonprofit, and sets forth the procedure for delivery.
Existing law requires the department to establish a track and trace program
for reporting the movement of cannabis and cannabis products throughout
the distribution chain and requires the program to capture certain information.
Existing law requires the program to include an electronic seed to sale
software tracking system with data points for the different stages of
commercial activity.
This bill would also require the department to incorporate delivery into
the track and trace program by January 1, 2023, and would authorize the
department to adopt and readopt emergency regulations to implement that
requirement, as specified. The bill, after the department incorporates delivery
into the track and trace program, as specified, would require the program
to capture the date of retail sale to a customer, whether the sale is on the
retail premises or by delivery, and information, as determined by those
emergency regulations, relating to cannabis or cannabis products leaving
the licensed premises in a delivery vehicle, and would require a licensed
retailer, before cannabis or a cannabis product leaves the licensed premises
in a delivery vehicle, to enter into the track and trace system all information
required by the department.
(5) Existing law makes it unlawful to deposit, permit to pass, or place
where it can pass, specified pollutants into the waters of this state, including
any substance or material deleterious to fish, plant life, mammals, or bird
life. A violation of this provision is a crime under the Fish and Game Code.
Existing law also subjects a violation of that provision to a civil penalty of
no more than $25,000 for each violation and an additional civil penalty of
no more than $10 for each gallon or pound of material discharged, and
requires the civil action to be brought by the Attorney General upon
95
Ch. 56 — 3 —
complaint by the Department of Fish and Wildlife or by the district attorney
or city attorney in the name of the people of the State of California. Existing
law provides that a specified affirmative defense to a violation of the criminal
provision does not apply to an action for civil penalties or injunctive relief
pursuant to that civil provision.
This bill would provide that the specified affirmative defense to a violation
of the criminal provision also does not apply in any other civil action that
alleges a violation resulting from unlicensed cannabis cultivation. The bill
would delete the requirement that the Attorney General only bring that civil
action upon complaint by the department and would authorize, for a violation
resulting from unlicensed cannabis cultivation, the civil action to be brought
by a county counsel in the name of the people of the State of California.
Existing law generally requires 1⁄2 of all fines and forfeitures imposed or
collected in any court of this state for violations of the Fish and Game Code
or any other law providing for the protection or preservation of birds,
mammals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians to be deposited in the county treasury
of the county in which the violation was committed. Existing law requires
those funds and other specified funds to be deposited in a county fish and
wildlife propagation fund and authorizes the county board of supervisors
to expend those funds for specified purposes.
This bill would additionally authorize expenditures from the fish and
wildlife propagation fund of a county for costs incurred by a county counsel
in investigating and prosecuting specified civil actions for violations resulting
from unlicensed cannabis cultivation.
(6) Under existing law, the diversion or use of water other than as
authorized by specified provisions of law is a trespass, subject to specified
civil liability and injunctive relief imposed in the superior court in actions
brought by the Attorney General upon request of the State Water Resources
Control Board. Existing law requires funds recovered pursuant to that
provision to be deposited in the Water Rights Fund, which is available upon
appropriation by the Legislature for specified purposes. Existing law imposes
fines of $1,000 for each day a trespass occurs and $2,500 for each acre-foot
of water diverted or used in excess of the diverter’s water rights.
This bill would authorize, for a violation resulting from unlicensed
cannabis cultivation, the civil action to be brought by a county counsel or
city attorney, upon approval of the board, in the name of the people of the
State of California. The bill would delete the requirement that the Attorney
General only bring the civil action upon request of the board. The bill would
require funds recovered pursuant to that provision, upon appropriation by
the Legislature, to be used to proportionally reimburse the Attorney General,
city attorney, county counsel, and the board for costs of bringing the action,
including reasonable attorney’s fees, for investigating the violation and
supporting the prosecution of the action. The bill would impose a penalty
of $3,500 per day for the unauthorized diversion or use for unlicensed
cannabis activity in lieu of the current fines.
(7) AUMA, as additionally amended by statute, imposes a weight-based
cultivation tax on harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market and
95
— 4 —
Ch. 56
a separate excise tax on purchasers of cannabis or cannabis products sold
in this state at the rate of 15% of the average market price of any retail sale
by a cannabis retailer, as specified. Existing law defines average market
price in an arm’s length transaction to mean the average retail price
determined by the wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products sold
or transferred to a cannabis retailer, plus a mark-up, as determined by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) on a
biannual basis in 6-month intervals. Existing law requires the distributor to
collect the excise tax from the cannabis retailer and to remit the tax to
CDTFA. Existing law requires revenues from the cultivation and excise
taxes to be deposited into the California Cannabis Tax Fund, and
continuously appropriates that tax fund for specified purposes.
This bill, beginning on January 1, 2023, would discontinue the imposition
of the cultivation tax. The bill, beginning on January 1, 2023, would impose
the cannabis excise tax on purchasers of cannabis or cannabis products sold
in this state at the rate of 15% of the gross receipts of any retail sale by a
cannabis retailer. The bill, for the 2025–26 fiscal year and every 2 years
thereafter, would require CDTFA, in consultation with the Department of
Finance, on or before May 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the
applicable fiscal year, to adjust the cannabis excise tax rate by a percentage
that will generate an amount of revenue that would have been collected
pursuant to the cultivation tax imposed prior to its discontinuation under
this bill, as specified, except that the bill would prohibit the cannabis tax
rate from exceeding 19% of the gross receipts of retail sale.
(8) AUMA, as additionally amended by statute, establishes the California
Cannabis Tax Fund as a continuously appropriated fund consisting of
specified taxes, interest, penalties, and other amounts related to commercial
cannabis activity. Each fiscal year, AUMA requires the Controller to make,
as specified, disbursements from the fund for various purposes, including,
among others, administering programs related to community reinvestment,
youth education, prevention, early intervention, and treatment, environmental
restoration and protection, and public health and safety. AUMA prohibits
the Legislature, prior to July 1, 2028, from changing the allocations to those
programs. Before making those disbursements, AUMA requires the
Controller to disburse funds to various state entities, including, among
others, the CDTFA, the Department of Cannabis Control, and the Controller,
for reasonable costs in carrying out their duties under AUMA.
This bill would prohibit the Controller from making specified
disbursements to certain state entities for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 fiscal
years. The bill, for the 2021–22, 2022–23, 2023–24, and 2024–25 fiscal
years, would require the Controller, after making specified disbursements,
to disburse funds in an amount not to exceed the 2020-21 fiscal year baseline,
as defined, into sub-trust accounts for administering those programs related
to community reinvestment, youth education, prevention, early intervention,
and treatment, environmental restoration and protection, and public health
and safety. The bill would require any amount of funds that exceeds the
2020-21 fiscal year baseline to remain in the tax fund and to be disbursed
95
Ch. 56 — 5 —
according to a specified schedule to enable funds disbursed to the sub-trust
accounts for the 2022–23, 2023–24, and 2024–25 fiscal years to be equal
to the 2020–21 fiscal year baseline. The bill would require, on or before
January 1, 2026, any remaining moneys in the tax fund retained pursuant
to these provisions and any interest derived to be disbursed to the sub-trust
accounts, as specified. The bill would appropriate $10,000 in the 2022–23
fiscal year, and $150,000,000 in the 2023–24 fiscal year, from the General
Fund, and require the Controller, pursuant to a specified schedule, to transfer
amounts of those moneys that would enable funds disbursed to the sub-trust
accounts for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 fiscal years to be equal to the
2020–21 fiscal year baseline.
(9) MAUCRSA requires the Department of Cannabis Control to
administer a grant program to assist with the development of a local
jurisdiction’s local equity program or to assist applicants and licensees in
a local jurisdiction’s equity program, and authorizes the department to
provide technical assistance to the local equity program. MAUCRSA defines
local equity program for these purposes to mean a program adopted or
operated by a local jurisdiction that focuses on inclusion and support of
individuals and communities in California’s cannabis industry who are
linked to populations or neighborhoods that were negatively or
disproportionately impacted by cannabis criminalization. MAUCRSA
required the department, on or before January 1, 2022, to develop and
implement a program to provide a waiver for an application fee, a licensing
fee, or a renewal fee for a needs-based applicant or needs-based licensee,
as specified. Existing law made the operation of those provisions contingent
upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or another statute for
purposes of those provisions.
This bill, until December 31, 2025, would authorize a licensed cannabis
retailer that has received approval from the department for a fee waiver for
an application fee, a licensing fee, or a renewal fee, as specified, to retain
a vender compensation in an amount equal to 20 percent of the cannabis
excise tax the licensee would otherwise be required to remit, if certain
conditions are met.
(10) Existing law requires the distributor to collect the cannabis excise
tax from the cannabis retailer and to remit the tax to CDTFA. Under existing
law, the cultivation tax and the cannabis excise tax collected by a distributor
or a manufacturer and any amount unreturned to the cultivator or retailer
that is not tax, but was collected under the representation by the distributor
or manufacturer that it was tax, constitute debts owed by the distributor or
manufacturer to this state. Existing law deems any tax collected from a
cultivator or retailer that has not been remitted to CDTFA a debt owed to
this state by the person required to collect and remit the tax. Existing law
requires a distributor to obtain a permit from CDTFA and provides that any
person required to obtain a permit and who engages in business as a
distributor without a valid permit is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill, beginning on January 1, 2023, would revise and recast the
provisions relating to the administration of the cannabis cultivation and
95
— 6 —
Ch. 56
cannabis excise taxes. The bill, among other things, would remove the
requirement that the distributor collect the cannabis excise tax from the
cannabis retailer, and would instead require the cannabis retailer to collect
the cannabis excise tax from the purchaser and to remit the cannabis excise
tax to CDTFA quarterly. The bill would deem any tax collected by the
cannabis retailer, and any amount unreturned to the purchaser that is not
tax, to constitute a debt owed to this state by the cannabis retailer, as
provided. The bill would authorize CDTFA to require a cannabis retailer
to file specified reports with CDTFA with respect to the person’s inventory,
purchases, and sales for purpose of administration of the cannabis excise
tax, and would authorize CDTFA to examine books and records for these
purposes. The bill would require a cannabis retailer to obtain a permit from
CDTFA, and would provide that any person required to obtain a permit and
who engages in business as a cannabis retailer without a valid permit is
guilty of a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a
state-mandated local program.
This bill would provide that an unlicensed person who is required to be
licensed under MAUCRSA and who possesses, keeps, stores, or retains for
the purpose of sale, or sells or offers to sell any cannabis or cannabis
products, is liable for the cannabis cultivation and cannabis excise taxes as
if they were the cultivator or purchaser, as specified. The bill would impose
an additional penalty in an amount equal to 25% of the amount of tax or
$500, whichever is greater. The bill would establish a procedure for relief
from the penalty, including a signed statement from the person, and would
provide that any person who asserts the truth of any material matter that
they know to be false in relation to these provisions is guilty of a
misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a
state-mandated local program.
(11) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow
various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws.
Existing federal law imposes an income tax upon every corporation,
except as specified, and prohibits the allowance of a deduction or credit for
any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade
or business consisting of trafficking in controlled substances, including
cannabis.
This bill would allow a credit against those taxes for each taxable year
beginning on or after January 1, 2023, until January 1, 2028, to a qualified
taxpayer, defined to mean a licensed commercial cannabis business that
meets specified criteria, in an amount equal to 25% of the total amount of
the qualified taxpayer’s qualified expenditures, as defined, in the taxable
year not to exceed $250,000 per taxable year, as specified. The bill would
cap the aggregate amount of the credit allowed, over all taxable years, at
$20,000,000.
This bill would allow an additional credit against those taxes for each
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and before January 1,
2028, to a cannabis equity licensee that received approval for a specified
fee waiver and deferral program administered by the Department of Cannabis
95
Ch. 56 — 7 —
Control, in an amount equal to $10,000. The bill would cap the aggregate
amount of the credit allowed, over all taxable years, at $20,000,000.
Existing law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to contain,
among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax
expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection
requirements.
This bill would include additional information required for any bill
authorizing a new tax expenditure.
(12) Under the Sales and Use Tax Law, a person whose estimated tax
liability under the law averages $10,000 or more per month is required to
remit amounts due by an electronic funds transfer, as specified. That law
imposes a penalty on a person who remits those taxes by means other than
appropriate electronic funds transfer. That law authorizes, until January 1,
2022, a person licensed to engage in commercial cannabis activity to remit
amounts due by a means other than electronic funds transfer, if the CDTFA
deems it necessary to facilitate collection of amounts due.
This bill would extend that authorization indefinitely, and would provide
that a person licensed to engage in commercial cannabis activity who failed
to remit amounts due by means of electronic funds transfer on and after
January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2023, is not subject to or is relieved
of any penalties imposed for failure to pay by electronic funds transfer.
(13) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local
agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory
provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for
a specified reason.
(14) AUMA authorizes legislative amendment of its provisions with a
2⁄3 vote of both houses, without submission to the voters, to further its
purposes and intent.
This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes and intent
of AUMA.
(15) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill
providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
Appropriation: yes.
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
SECTION 1. (a) It is imperative that the cannabis supply chain be taxed
and regulated in a way that drives out the illicit market, as intended by the
voters in enacting the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana
Act. The current cannabis tax structure, contrary to the voters’ intent, has
pushed producers and consumers into the unlicensed market and prevented
the expansion of the licensed market, allowing the illicit market to persist.
Changes to the existing cannabis tax structure are therefore necessary to
further the purposes and intent of the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use
95
— 8 —
Ch. 56
of Marijuana Act by reducing barriers to entry into the legal, regulated
cannabis market and combating the illicit market.
(b) It is also imperative that the cannabis supply chain be taxed in a way
that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in new state revenue annually
for restoring and repairing the environment, education, prevention, and
treatment of youth substance use disorders, community investment, and
public safety-related activities, as intended by the voters in enacting the
Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act.
(c) The purpose of the amendments to the cannabis cultivation and excise
taxes by this act is to achieve these goals by simplifying the state’s cannabis
tax structure. By consolidating the state’s cannabis taxes into a single excise
tax imposed at the point of retail sale, the state can tax the entire cannabis
supply chain—from cultivation to sale—in a manner that is more efficient
and transparent, thereby lowering barriers to entry into the legal, regulated
cannabis market.
(d) By combating the illicit market and encouraging consumers and
businesses to enter into the legal, regulated cannabis market, these changes
may increase the state’s cannabis tax revenue while reducing unnecessary
burdens imposed on the state’s legal cannabis businesses. The transition to
a new cannabis tax structure may be accompanied by short-term volatility,
even if that transition is successful in the long term. During this transitional
period, the recipients identified in subdivision (b)—programs for restoring
and repairing the environment, youth education, treatment, and substance
use prevention, community investment, and public safety—may require
support from the state and its general fund to provide a more predictable
revenue stream.
(e) Therefore, the purpose of the amendments to the cannabis cultivation
and excise taxes by this act is to tax the cannabis supply chain in a way that
reduces barriers to entry into the legal market and drives out the illicit
market, while providing transitional stabilization and support to existing
recipients of cannabis tax revenues.
SEC. 2. Section 26038 of the Business and Professions Code is amended
to read:
26038. (a) (1) A person engaging in commercial cannabis activity
without a license as required by this division shall be subject to civil penalties

day of operation shall constitute a separate violation of this section.
(2) A person aiding and abetting unlicensed commercial cannabis activity
shall be subject to civil penalties of up to three times the amount of the
license fee for each violation, but in no case shall the penalty exceed thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000) for each violation. Each day of operation of
unlicensed commercial cannabis activity that a person is found to have aided

(3) A person who has management or control of a commercial property,
or a commercial building, room, space, or enclosure, either as an owner,
lessee, agent, employee, or mortgagee, who knowingly rents, leases, or
makes available for use, with or without compensation, the commercial
95
Ch. 56 — 9 —
property, building, room, space, or enclosure for the purpose of the
unlicensed commercial cultivation, manufacture, storage, sale, or distribution
of cannabis shall be subject to civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars
($10,000) for each violation. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate
violation of this section.
(4) In assessing a penalty, a court shall give due consideration to the
appropriateness of the amount of the civil penalty with respect to factors
the court determines to be relevant, including the following:
(A) The gravity of the violation by the licensee or person.
(B) The good faith of the licensee or person.
(C) The licensee’s or person’s history of previous violations.
(D) Whether, and to what extent, the licensee or person profited from
the unlicensed cannabis activity.
(5) Cannabis associated with a violation described in this subdivision
may be destroyed in accordance with Section 11479 of the Health and Safety
Code. The person in violation shall be responsible for the cost of the
destruction of cannabis associated with their violation.
(b) An action for civil penalties brought against a person pursuant to this
division shall not be commenced unless the action is filed within three years
from the date of the violation.
(c) All civil penalties imposed and collected pursuant to this section by

demonstrated:
(1) The person was an owner, officer, controlling shareholder, or in a
similar position of authority allowing them to make command or control
decisions regarding the operations and management of the unlicensed
cannabis activity or the property in which the activity is taking place.
(2) The person had actual knowledge that the cannabis activity was
unlicensed and that the cannabis activity required a license.
(3) The person provided substantial assistance or encouragement to the
unlicensed cannabis activity.
(4) The person’s conduct was a substantial factor in furthering the
unlicensed cannabis activity.
(e) (1) If an action for civil penalties is brought against a person pursuant
to this division by the Attorney General on behalf of the people or on behalf
of the department or a participating agency, the penalty shall first be used
to reimburse the Attorney General and the department or the participating
agency for the costs of investigating and prosecuting the action, including
expert fees and reasonable attorney’s fees, with the remainder, if any, to be
deposited into the General Fund.
(2) If the action is brought by a county counsel, the penalty shall first be
used to reimburse the county counsel for the costs of bringing the action
for civil penalties, with the remainder, if any, to be deposited into the General
Fund.
95
— 10 —
Ch. 56
(3) If the action is brought by a city attorney or city prosecutor, the
penalty collected shall first be used to reimburse the city attorney or city
prosecutor for the costs of bringing the action for civil penalties, with the
remainder, if any, to be deposited into the General Fund.
(4) Actions for civil penalties pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision
(a) shall be brought exclusively by the Attorney General on behalf of the
people, on behalf of the department, or on behalf of the participating agency,
or by a city or county counsel or city prosecutor in a city or county having
a population in excess of 750,000.
(5) Actions for civil penalties pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision
(a) shall be brought exclusively by the Attorney General on behalf of the
people, on behalf of the department, or on behalf of the participating agency,
or by a city or county counsel, or city prosecutor.
(f) For purposes of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), in order to prove
that a person knowingly rented, leased, or made available the commercial
property for unlawful commercial cannabis activity, it shall be demonstrated
that the person had actual knowledge that the cannabis-related activity was
for commercial purposes, required a license, and was unlicensed. The
presence of a lawful amount of cannabis, cannabis products, or cannabis
plants, subject to Sections 11362.1 and 11362.45 of the Health and Safety
Code, shall not be evidence of actual knowledge.
(g) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), criminal penalties shall continue to
apply to an unlicensed person engaging in commercial cannabis activity in
violation of this division.
(h) (1) This section does not limit, preempt, or otherwise affect any other
state or local law, rule, regulation, or ordinance applicable to the conduct
described in subdivision (a), or otherwise relating to commercial cannabis
activities.
(2) This section is meant to further the intent of the Control, Regulate
and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act of 2016 (AUMA), which allows local
governments to reasonably regulate the cultivation of nonmedical cannabis
for personal use by adults 21 years of age and older through zoning and
other local laws.
SEC. 3. Section 26051.5 of the Business and Professions Code is
amended to read:
26051.5. (a) An applicant for a state license issued pursuant to this
division to conduct commercial cannabis activity, as defined in Section
26001, shall do all of the following:
(1) Require that each owner electronically submit to the Department of
Justice fingerprint images and related information required by the
Department of Justice for the purpose of obtaining information as to the
existence and content of a record of state or federal convictions and state
and federal arrests, and also information as to the existence and content of
a record of state or federal convictions and arrests for which the Department

other document refers. Cannabis shall not be sold unless the tax has been

documentation under this paragraph.

waste or medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis products designated for
donation, shall be presumed to be sold and thereby taxable under this section,
except as otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 34012.2.
(j) The tax imposed by this section shall be imposed on all cannabis

state in the amount of the tax, penalties, and interest at the modified adjusted
rate per month, or fraction thereof, established pursuant to Section 6591.5,

members of the task force created by Section 26203 of the Business and
Professions Code to more freely share information, and otherwise coordinate,
regarding those investigations; and to otherwise promote fuller cooperation
among members of the task force to enforce applicable state and local laws,
